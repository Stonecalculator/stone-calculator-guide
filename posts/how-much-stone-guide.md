## Why Stone Estimation Matters

Stone is commonly used for:
- Driveways
- Patios
- Walkways
- Base layers

Accurate measurements help avoid waste and ensure smooth project planning.

## How a Stone Calculator Works

A stone calculator uses three main inputs:
- **Length**
- **Width**
- **Depth**

By entering these values, the calculator estimates the total volume of stone required.

## Estimating Stone by Bags, Yards, or Tons

Stone is commonly sold in:
- **Bags** (small projects)
- **Cubic yards** (bulk orders)
- **Tons** (supplier measurements)

A calculator helps convert volume into practical purchase quantities.

## Common Estimation Mistakes to Avoid

- Guessing depth instead of measuring
- Ignoring compaction
- Ordering without extra allowance

Using a calculator reduces these errors.

## Final Thoughts

Stone calculators simplify planning by providing standardized estimates. Always confirm your final order with your material supplier before purchasing.
